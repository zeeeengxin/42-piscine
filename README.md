# 42-piscine

From a person who knew nothing about programming, a person who didn't know how to even open folders in terminal, to a C language beginner who can wrote loops and recursions, can solve sudoku and wrote even bigger projects, I truly learned a lot during the piscine and enjoyed coding with new friends. Great great experience with happiness and sadness, anger, and comfort. I'll always remember the 4 weeks full of coding.

### Exercises ###
The videos provided by 42 really sucked... Got misled a lot by the videos especially for people like me who knew nothing about computer programming before the piscine. I finished some of the exercises that I didn't finish during the piscine and reviewed these exerices while reading a C language book.

### 42 University @Silicon Valley ###
"42 Silicon Valley is an innovative engineering college in the San Francisco Bay Area, a non-profit organization (NPO) based in California.

The 42 program is a 3 to 5 year college-level software engineering or coding program in a professional environment. There are no classes, teachers, or courses and instead we use project-based learning, skills mastery, peer-to-peer correction, and gamification to foster learning."

### 42 piscine ###
"Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to come and spend 4 weeks, 7 days a week, day and night, coding your heart out with several hundred other candidates all hoping to earn the same prize: to be a full-time student at 42."

### The Norme ###
All projects must be written in C and must be according to the Norme coding standard. See Norme.en.pdf

I wrote some comments for some exercises about why I didn't pass the tests.
